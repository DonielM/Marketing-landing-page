Marketing-landing-page

This is a demo marketing landing page for a website based around online marketing. I used semantic elements to arrange the content on the page. Added a descriptive title, made sure all the image and icon elements have alt attributes. Finally I refactored the css code, consolidating different classes with the same styling together reducing the lines of code used. finally i added this read me and deployed the site to allow users to view the site and the documented changes via github.
